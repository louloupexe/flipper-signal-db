# 📡 Flipper Signal DB

A community-maintained database of Sub-GHz signal files (`.sub`) recorded with the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). Browse, download, and contribute signals through a clean static web interface — no backend required.

**Live site:** [og34.github.io/flipper-signal-db](https://og34.github.io/flipper-signal-db)

---

## Features

- 🔍 **Search** by signal name, frequency, or protocol
- 🏷️ **Filter** by category (garage doors, car keys, intercoms, weather stations, custom)
- 📥 **Download** `.sub` files directly from the browser
- 📬 **Contribute** new signals via Pull Request

## signals.json Format

Each signal is an object in the top-level array:

```json
{
  "name":        "Generic Garage Door 433MHz",
  "frequency":   "433.92 MHz",
  "protocol":    "OOK",
  "description": "Common single-channel remote at 433 MHz.",
  "category":    "garage_doors",
  "region":      "eu",
  "contributor": "your_github_username",
  "filename":    "garage_door_433.sub"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `name` | Short, human-readable signal name |
| `frequency` | e.g. `"433.92 MHz"` or `"315.00 MHz"` |
| `protocol` | e.g. `"OOK"`, `"Princeton"`, `"RAW"`, `"Acurite-609TXC"` |
| `description` | One or two sentences about what was captured and where |
| `category` | One of the category keys above |
| `region` | `"eu"` (433/868 MHz), `"us"` (315/433/915 MHz), or `"global"` |
| `contributor` | Your GitHub username |
| `filename` | Basename of the `.sub` file inside `signals/` |

### Regions & Frequencies

| Region | Common Frequencies | Key |
|---|---|---|
| 🇪🇺 Europe | 433.92 MHz, 868.35 MHz | `eu` |
| 🇺🇸 North America | 315 MHz, 433.92 MHz, 915 MHz | `us` |
| 📡 Global | Works in both regions | `global` |

## How to Contribute

### Option A — GitHub web UI (easiest)

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/og34/flipper-signal-db/fork).
2. Upload your `.sub` file to the `signals/` folder via the GitHub file editor.
3. Edit `signals.json` and append a new entry for your signal.
4. Open a Pull Request against `main`.

### Option B — Git CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/flipper-signal-db.git
cd flipper-signal-db

# Copy your .sub file
cp ~/path/to/my_signal.sub signals/

# Edit signals.json to add your entry, then:
git add signals/my_signal.sub signals.json
git commit -m "feat: add My Signal 433MHz"
git push origin main
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Guidelines

- ✅ Include accurate frequency and protocol information.
- ✅ Use a descriptive `filename` (e.g. `brand_model_freq.sub`).
- ✅ Write a clear `description` — what device, what action, where captured.
- ❌ Do not submit signals for devices or frequencies you do not own or have explicit permission to capture.
- ❌ Do not submit rolling-code signals that could compromise real-world security systems.
- ❌ No personally identifiable information in signal files.

## Running Locally

Because the page fetches `signals.json` via `fetch()`, you need a local HTTP server (not `file://`):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080

# Node.js (npx)
npx serve .

# Then open http://localhost:8080
```

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in your fork.
2. Set Source to **Deploy from a branch** → `main` → `/ (root)`.
3. Your site will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/flipper-signal-db`.
